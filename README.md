# Academic Progress Tool
Deployed using AWS LightSail I developed a Web based application www.gradecalculator.ca using C, JavaScript, Java, HTML/CSS and MySQL to parse an
academic course outline to create a table of all course assessments and their weights allowing the Users to calculate and store their real time
progress and course marks. All files are stored using AWS S3 buckets.
