6.3 Course and Grading Policies
Online Assignments: Assignments are done through an online assessment system. Students 
will have 4 attempts for each assignment, with the highest attempted mark counting as the 
assignment grade. The best 5 marks of the 6 assignments will be used in the calculation of 
the final grade; the lowest assignment mark will be discarded. This is to account for various 
problems (computer issues, poor performance on an assignment, illness, overloaded 
schedule, etc.), and is the only accommodation that will be made. No late assignments will be 
accepted and missed assignments will automatically receive a grade of 0. 
 
Data Analysis Projects: Details regarding each of the data analysis projects will be posted on 
Courselink. Projects must be handed in by the posted due date/time. No late projects will be 
accepted and missed projects will automatically receive a grade of 0. Students who cannot 
complete a project for a valid reason will, upon my approval, have the weight of the missed 
project added to their final exam. 
 
IT IS IN YOUR BEST INTEREST TO COMPLETE EVERY ASSIGNMENT AND PROJECT 
 
STUDENTS WHO MISS MULTIPLE ASSIGNMENTS/PROJECTS WILL NEED TO PROVIDE 
DOCUMENTATION IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED FOR ACCOMMODATION 
 
Turnitin: In this course, we will be using Turnitin, integrated with the CourseLink Dropbox tool, 
to detect possible plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration or copying as part of the ongoing 
efforts to maintain academic integrity at the University of Guelph. 
 
All submitted data analysis projects will be included as source documents in the Turnitin.com 
reference database solely for the purpose of detecting plagiarism of such papers. Use of the 
Turnitin.com service is subject to the Usage Policy posted on the Turnitin.com site. 
 
Data analysis projects that are flagged on Turnitin will be subject to further examination, 
however this does not automatically mean that academic misconduct has occurred.  In the 
event that a more detailed examination does in fact suggest academic misconduct may have 
occurred, an official investigation will be launched through the CEPS Dean’s Office.

STAT*2060 C01, C02 F19 v1.00
 
Term Tests: Term tests are scheduled for Friday evenings to minimize conflicts. Students 
who are aware before the test date of a conflict must contact me immediately to discuss their 
situation. Only valid conflicts such as another scheduled test, a religious accommodation, or 
a varsity sport will be considered for accommodation, and supporting documentation must 
be provided. Students who miss a test for medical illness must obtain a medical note for their 
absence and contact me within 5 business days of the missed test. In the case of absence 
due to medical illness, a student’s final exam will be reweighted to make up for the missed 
test 
 
The final exam (date, time and location) is scheduled by the Registrar’s Office. Students who 
miss the final exam due to a valid, documented reason must contact their program counsellor 
for advice on University regulations regarding final exams. These procedures are based on 
University policy and are not under the control of the course instructor. 
 
The format of the term tests and the final exam will be posted at a later date. Students will be 
allowed a stand-alone calculator (i.e. must not be part of a cell phone, laptop, etc.), and are 
permitted to have one double-sided letter size (8.5’’ X 11’’) reference page for each of the two 
term tests (that is, ONE double-sided 8.5” X 11” reference page per term test). Students are 
allowed two double-sided 8.5” X 11” reference pages for the final exam. Reference pages 
must be handwritten. Any required statistical values will be provided. No other resources are 
permitted. 
 
In order to uphold the University of Guelph’s academic integrity standards, the term tests will 
be scanned and digitally stored before graded tests are returned to the students. Any work 
that is submitted for regrading will be compared to the corresponding digital copy. Note that 
in the event that a student submits a test for regrading, I reserve the right to regrade the entire 
test, not just the question under consideration. Procedures for submitting a regrade request 
will be posted on Courselink. 
 
Regrade requests must be submitted within two weeks of an assignment/project/test being 
returned, after which regrade requests may no longer be submitted, and the 
assignment/project/test grade is final. 
 
Course Policy on Group Work:  Students are encouraged to work together to discuss course 
content, share ideas, and ask/answer questions. However, all online assignments, term tests, 
Page 8 of 11
STAT*2060 C01, C02 F19 v1.00
and final exam in this course must be completed independently.  The data analysis projects 
can be completed in groups of no more than 3 people, with explicit instructions regarding this 
group work posted on Courselink. Any unauthorized collaboration, completing another 
student’s work, or having another student complete your work, will constitute academic 
misconduct.

7 University Statements
7.1 Email Communication
As per university regulations, all students are required to check their e-mail account regularly: 
e-mail is the official route of communication between the University and its students.
7.2 When You Cannot Meet a Course Requirement
When you find yourself unable to meet an in-course requirement because of illness or 
compassionate reasons please advise the course instructor (or designated person, such as a 
teaching assistant) in writing, with your name, id#, and e-mail contact. The grounds for 
Academic Consideration are detailed in the Undergraduate and Graduate Calendars.

7.4 Copies of Out-of-class Assignments
Keep paper and/or other reliable back-up copies of all out-of-class assignments: you may be 
asked to resubmit work at any time.
7.5 Accessibility
The University promotes the full participation of students who experience disabilities in their 
academic programs. To that end, the provision of academic accommodation is a shared 
responsibility between the University and the student. 
 
When accommodations are needed, the student is required to first register with Student 
Accessibility Services (SAS). Documentation to substantiate the existence of a disability is 
required; however, interim accommodations may be possible while that process is underway. 
 
Accommodations are available for both permanent and temporary disabilities. It should be 
noted that common illnesses such as a cold or the flu do not constitute a disability. 
 
Use of the SAS Exam Centre requires students to book their exams at least 7 days in advance 
and not later than the 40th Class Day. 
 
For Guelph students, information can be found on the SAS website 
https://www.uoguelph.ca/sas 
 
For Ridgetown students, information can be found on the Ridgetown SAS website 
https://www.ridgetownc.com/services/accessibilityservices.cfm 
 
7.6 Academic Integrity
The University of Guelph is committed to upholding the highest standards of academic 
integrity, and it is the responsibility of all members of the University community-faculty, staff, 
and students-to be aware of what constitutes academic misconduct and to do as much as 
possible to prevent academic offences from occurring. University of Guelph students have 
the responsibility of abiding by the University's policy on academic misconduct regardless of 
their location of study; faculty, staff, and students have the responsibility of supporting an 
environment that encourages academic integrity. Students need to remain aware that 
instructors have access to and the right to use electronic and other means of detection. 
 
Please note: Whether or not a student intended to commit academic misconduct is not 
relevant for a finding of guilt. Hurried or careless submission of assignments does not excuse 
students from responsibility for verifying the academic integrity of their work before 
submitting it. Students who are in any doubt as to whether an action on their part could be 
construed as an academic offence should consult with a faculty member or faculty advisor.
