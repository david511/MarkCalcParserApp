This course provides an introduction to different programming paradigms followed by a detailed 
study on the compilation process of a procedural programming language.  Students will gain an 
in-depth understanding of the compiler construction process by considering the fundamental 
issues such as scanning, parsing, building and checking the intermediate representation of a 
program, and code generation.  The knowledge learned will be put into practice through the 
construction of a fully functioning compiler for a simple procedural language using the widely 
adopted tools (JFlex and CUP) and a general purpose programming language (Java).  More 
specifically, the implementation exercises are designed to reinforce various concepts that are 
typically abstracted by tools during compiler construction in order to provide a complete picture 
of the compiler design and implementation process. 
 
Students are expected to have a solid background in modular programming, assembly language, 
and basic computer architecture (e.g., registers, memory organization, etc.).  Experience with the 
development of large software projects such as those practiced in CIS*2750, CIS*3750, and 
CIS*3760 will be beneficial. 
 
Evaluation 
• Warmup assignment: 10% (due on Jan. 30) 
• Three checkpoints for the project: 45% (due on Mar. 2, Mar. 18, and Apr. 1) 
• Midterm: 20% (scheduled on Feb. 12 during the class time) 
• Final exam: 25% (scheduled on Apr. 14 between 8:30 and 10:30 am)  
Lecture attendance is important.  The textbook and lecture notes will not necessarily provide 
adequate coverage for the course materials, especially the discussions and question answering we 
conduct during the classes. Late submissions for the implementation are not encouraged, and 
there will be a deduction of marks by 10% for one day late, 25% for two days late, and 50% for 
three days late.  No marks will be given for late submissions that are more than three days late.
