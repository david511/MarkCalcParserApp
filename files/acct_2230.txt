Keep a copy of all of your graded work until final marks have been recorded. You may be 
asked to resubmit your work at any time. 
Midterm: 
The midterm will be held in class on October 17, and will cover Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7. 
More details regarding the midterm will be posted on Courselink. There is no deferred 
midterm. If you miss the midterm, you must provide a valid reason (i.e. illness or 
bereavement) and supporting documentation within one week of the missed midterm. If this 
is provided, the weight of the midterm will be added to your final exam. 
 
Final Exam: 
5 
 
The final exam is cumulative and will cover the entire course. While the focus will be on 
material covered after the midterm, specific concepts from before the midterm could be 
tested. In addition, much of the material in the later portion of the course builds on material 
covered in the earlier weeks. The final examination schedule for the semester can be found 
on the Office of Registrarial Services website. 
 
Teaching and Learning Practices   
Class 
Preparation 
and Review 
 Each week, you are expected to complete the self-assessment quiz on the CONNECT 
site. These assessments will help you determine whether you are prepared for that 
topic’s sessions. These quizzes must be completed by 11:59 pm on the day the topic is 
scheduled but frequently on the Friday after the chapter/topic is covered. Reading 
guides are valuable in assisting your preparation and success in the course. Confirm 
due dates on Cengage.   
Camtasia 
Videos 
The instructor may be using screen capture technology to record solutions to the 
assigned problems completed in class. These videos will be in MP4 format and posted 
1-2 days after the class has taken place. They in no way replace attendance in class as 
they only focus on those matters recorded and potentially not what the individual 
student may wish to have addressed in class. 
Top Hat 
Most if not all classes will have opportunities for students to interact using Top Hat 
Software to answer questions posed in Class by the instructor. Half of the grades are 
based on answering 65% of the questions and the other half of the grades are based 
on answering 65% of the questions correctly. Should a student not achieve the 65% 
standard in either measure, their grade will be prorated to the 65% level.  
Should any student have any concerns regarding the use of TopHat, they are required 
to advise the professor prior to the second week of classes.

Grading Policies 
Unless you have discussed an extension well ahead of the due date with the instructor, late 
penalties of 5% of the total grade earned per day (including weekends) will be assigned to any 
assessment (i.e. deducted from the total mark). Extensions will only be granted on the basis of 
valid medical or personal reasons and need to be requested via email to the instructor as soon 
as possible. Late assignments will not be accepted once graded assignments have been 
6 
 
returned officially to the class at large, unless circumstances permit and alternative 
arrangements have been made. 
 
Students who find themselves unable to meet course requirements by the deadlines or the 
criteria expected because of medical or personal reasons, should review the regulations on 
academic consideration in the Academic Calendar and discuss their situation with the 
instructor, program counselor or other academic counselor as appropriate.

A grade of zero will be assigned if you fail to submit an assignment, unless you are ill or have 
other compassionate reasons. Please read your Undergraduate Calendar for the regulations 
regarding illness and compassionate grounds. Please note, vacation travel, moving homes, or 
outside work commitments will not be accepted as valid reasons for missing deadlines. 
 
If you have religious observances which conflict with the course schedule or if you are 
registered with Student Accessibility Services, please contact the course instructor in order to 
make arrangements for your assessment if appropriate.

Academic Misconduct 
The University of Guelph is committed to upholding the highest standards of academic integrity 
and it is the responsibility of all members of the University community, faculty, staff, and 
students  to be aware of what constitutes academic misconduct and to do as much as possible 
to prevent academic offences from occurring.  
University of Guelph students have the responsibility of abiding by the University's policy on 
academic misconduct regardless of their location of study; faculty, staff and students have the 
responsibility of supporting an environment that discourages misconduct. Students need to 
remain aware that instructors have access to and the right to use electronic and other means 
of detection. Please note: Whether or not a student intended to commit academic misconduct 
is not relevant for a finding of guilt. Hurried or careless submission of assignments does not 
excuse students from responsibility for verifying the academic integrity of their work before
