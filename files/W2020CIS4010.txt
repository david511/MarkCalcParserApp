Copies of Out-of-class Assignments
Keep paper and/or other reliable back-up copies of all out-of-class assignments:
you may be asked to resubmit work at any time.
Accessibility
The University promotes the full participation of students who experience dis-
abilities in their academic programs. To that end, the provision of academic
accommodation is a shared responsibility between the University and the stu-
dent. When accommodations are needed, the student is required to first register
with Student Accessibility Services (SAS). Documentation to substantiate the
existence of a disability is required; however, interim accommodations may be
possible while that process is underway. Accommodations are available for both
permanent and temporary disabilities. It should be noted that common illnesses
such as a cold or the flu do not constitute a disability. Use of the SAS Exam
Centre requires students to book their exams at least 7 days in advance and not
later than the 40th Class Day. Information can be found on the SAS website
https://www.uoguelph.ca/sas
Academic Integrity
The University of Guelph is committed to upholding the highest standards of
academic integrity, and it is the responsibility of all members of the University
community-faculty, staff, and students-to be aware of what constitutes academic
misconduct and to do as much as possible to prevent academic offences from
occurring. University of Guelph students have the responsibility of abiding
by the University’s policy on academic misconduct regardless of their location
of study; faculty, staff, and students have the responsibility of supporting an
environment that encourages academic integrity. Students need to remain aware
that instructors have access to and the right to use electronic and other means of
detection. Please note: Whether or not a student intended to commit academic
misconduct is not relevant for a finding of guilt. Hurried or careless submission
of assignments does not excuse students from responsibility for verifying the
academic integrity of their work before submitting it. Students who are in any
doubt as to whether an action on their part could be construed as an academic
offence should consult with a faculty member or faculty advisor.
