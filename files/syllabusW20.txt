General Course Description 
The objectives of this course are to develop skills in the design and analysis of digital logic 
components and circuits, to make students thoroughly familiar with the basics of gate-level 
circuit design starting from single gates and building up to complex systems, and to provide 
exposure to circuit design using a schematic entry based computer-aided design tool.  
 
Course Content 
Each line corresponds to roughly one week of the semester. 
•   Overview of digital logic design 
•   Logic gates, DeMorgan's Equivalent Forms, positive and negative logic 
•   Truth tables, SOP and POS expressions, Karnaugh maps, Quine-McCluskey method 
•   Arithmetic Circuits: adder, subtractor, carry-lookahead adder 
•   Generalized ALU design, combinational multiplier 
•   Steering Logic: multiplexers, de-multiplexers, decoders, encoders 
•   Comparators,  parity generation/detection circuits 
•   Sequential logic: SR, D,  latches, SR, D, JK, T, flip flops, registers 
•   Finite-State Machines; state minimization 
•   Up/down counters, ring counters 
•   Sequential multiplier (datapath and controller) 
•   Random-Access Memory (RAM): SRAM and DRAM 
•   Programmable Devices: PROMs, PALs, PLAs, and FPGAs

Lectures 
There will be three lectures per week: MWF (10:30am – 11:20am) in CRSC 117. Due to the 
nature of the course material most of the lecture material will be presented on the chalk board. 
Therefore, please make sure to attend class regularly. No online notes are available.   
 
Homework 
Homework problems will be assigned each Monday and will be due the following Monday at the 
beginning of class.  Solutions will be made available the following week in the lab. Late 
assignments will not be accepted. However, your lowest assignment mark will be dropped when 
computing your final grade.

Laboratory Exercises 
Each week you will be designing and simulating various digital circuits using LogicWorks - a 
Windows based software package. You are required to complete and receive a mark for each 
exercise during your scheduled two-hour weekly lab session. Late lab assignments will not be 
accepted. Also, you cannot move between lab sections. Therefore, it is strongly recommended 
that you prepare for each lab exercise before attending the lab.   
 
 
Course Evaluation 
 
Weight Description 
15% Weekly Homework Assignments 
-   weighted equally  
-    start January 7 
30% Weekly Laboratory Exercises  
-   labs 1 through 10 (equal weight) 
-   lab 11 (5%)  
-   see lab schedule for dates 
30% Test 1  (15%)   
-   February 7 (in class; weight of a missed test will be added to final exam) 
Test 2  (15%) 
-   March 16 (in class; weight of a missed test will be added to final exam) 
25% Final Exam (April 9, 7-9pm) 
 
You must achieve a passing grade on the testing portion of the course (i.e., 27.5 out of 55) and 
on the lab portion of the course (i.e., 15 out of 30). If you fail to achieve a grade of at least 50% 
in either of these two cases, the highest final grade that you can achieve is 45%. In this case, a 
final grade which is greater than 45% will be reduced to 45%. A final grade of 45% or less will 
remain unchanged.  
 
 
Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) 
 
•   Nastaran Bateni    nbateni@uoguelph.ca 
•   Hannah Szentimrey  szentimh@uoguelph.ca 
 
 
GTAs are responsible for marking homework assignments and lab exercises. All requests for re-
grades must be made by email to the GTA who marked the item within one week of the marked 
item being returned.  
 
 
Advising Hours 
An open-door policy will be applied throughout the semester; otherwise, please email me (Gary) 
to request a specific meeting time. Please do not send questions by email.

A Word of Caution 
 
Needless to say, plagiarism in any form must be dealt with severely. Discussion with fellow 
students about problems is healthy. However, when answering questions do it yourself. Be 
original. All cases of academic misconduct are handled by the Dean, in conjunction with the 
Associate Director of the School. Successive infractions of misconduct affirmed by this process 
could have consequences as serious as expulsion from the University. (It is your responsibility to 
acquaint yourself with the definitions and ramifications of academic misconduct as described in 
the university’s undergraduate Calendar.) The risks are sufficiently great that they are not worth 
taking.  If you are having trouble, please see the teaching assistant or the instructor for help.
