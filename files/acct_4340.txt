Course Description 
This course will draw on accounting research, primarily empirical research. Rather than covering specific 
GAAP rules, the course will focus on how investors react to GAAP rules, why financial information is 
important, and how its use/misuse affects investor decision making and management behaviour. The course 
is thus about accounting, instead of about how to apply accounting standards. 
The course will introduce students to accounting research and the theories that inform the development of 
accounting practices and our understanding of the role of accounting in society.  Students will critically 
examine contemporary issues in accounting including accounting education, earnings management, 
accounting for sustainability, governance and accounting information as a public good.

Academic Misconduct 
The University of Guelph is committed to upholding the highest standards of academic integrity and it is the 
responsibility of all members of the University community, faculty, staff, and students to be aware of what 
constitutes academic misconduct and to do as much as possible to prevent academic offences from occurring.  
University of Guelph students have the responsibility of abiding by the University's policy on academic 
misconduct regardless of their location of study; faculty, staff and students have the responsibility of supporting 
an environment that discourages misconduct. Students need to remain aware that instructors have access to 
and the right to use electronic and other means of detection. Please note: Whether or not a student intended 
to commit academic misconduct is not relevant for a finding of guilt. Hurried or careless submission of 
assignments does not excuse students from responsibility for verifying the academic integrity of their work 
before submitting it. Students who are in any doubt as to whether an action on their part could be construed 
as an academic offence should consult with a faculty member or faculty advisor.
