Course Description: 
 
The introduction of the 1982 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms has changed the Canadian 
political landscape dramatically. This course will introduce students to the political implications of 
the Charter through a combination of historical material, judicial decisions, and scholarly debates. 
The early weeks of the course will situate the Charter in its historical context, exploring the debates 
surrounding Patriation and the effect of the Charter on society. The course will then shift to judicial 
decisions themselves, as students will become familiar with the development of judicial decision-
making over the past three decades, and examine how the Supreme Court of Canada has shaped 
public policy in the post-Charter era. The course will conclude by moving from the courts to other 
political institutions, exploring the Charter’s continuing influence on executives, legislatures, 
bureaucrats, electoral politics, interest groups, and society. 
 
By the end of this course, students should be able to identify and critically evaluate the relevant 
political and scholarly debates, past and present, that surround the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms. Students should be familiar with the historical development of the Charter, including the 
reasons for its successful entrenchment, its influence and popularity, and its continued significance 
in shaping public policy. Finally, students should be able to effectively communicate, in both oral 
and written form, how the Charter has changed the way Canadians govern and are governed, 
particularly with respect to the “judicialization of politics” and the “politicization of the judiciary.”

POLICIES 
 
TESTS AND EXAMS  
 
Tests and exams will cover material from both the lectures and the readings.  Special arrangements 
for writing tests will only be made for a compelling reason (serious illness, family crisis, etc.) and if 
notification has been given PRIOR to the test (or in case of emergency as soon as possible).  
 
All Papers and Exams are to be completed individually – i.e., without collaboration. Students 
must write assignments in their own words, and all written assignments must be completed 
independently unless the instructor indicates otherwise. Failure to do so constitutes academic 
misconduct. Please see the University of Guelph Undergraduate Calendar for academic regulations, 
including rules surrounding academic misconduct 
(https://www.uoguelph.ca/registrar/calendars/undergraduate/current/c08/c08-amisconduct.shtml). 
 
 
LATE PAPERS AND APPEALS 
 
The penalty for LATE PAPERS and ASSIGNMENTS will be 5% per day, including weekends, 
and extensions will only be granted for emergency circumstances. Papers will not be accepted ten 
days after the initial due date. Extensions requested AFTER the assignment deadline will not be 
granted.  
 
Students have the option of appealing their assignment grades to the instructor, whether those 
grades were graded by the instructor or a teaching assistant. To appeal, the student must email the 
professor a one-paragraph statement explaining why the grade should be changed, and subsequently 
meet with the professor. This email must occur within seven days of receiving the initial grade. On 
an appeal, the professor will grade the assignment independently, which means that the original 
grade can go up or down. 
 
COURSELINK 
 
This course uses CourseLink. The site will be used as a course administration tool; detailed 
assignment guidelines and course resources will be posted. Please see CourseLink for course 
outline, assignments, lecture notes, announcements, supplementary course material, and grade-
related items. Students must check this site regularly.  All written assignments will be submitted 
through CourseLink. 
 
 
TURNITIN 
 
In this course, your instructor will be using Turnitin, integrated with the CourseLink Dropbox tool, 
to detect possible plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration or copying as part of the ongoing efforts to 
maintain academic integrity at the University of Guelph. 
 
 4 
All submitted assignments will be included as source documents in the Turnitin.com reference 
database solely for the purpose of detecting plagiarism of such papers. Use of the Turnitin.com 
service is subject to the Usage Policy posted on the Turnitin.com site. 
 
A major benefit of using Turnitin is that students will be able to educate and empower themselves in 
preventing academic misconduct. In this course, you may screen your own assignments through 
Turnitin as many times as you wish before the due date. You will be able to see and print reports 
that show you exactly where you have properly and improperly referenced the outside sources and 
materials in your assignment. 
 
 
LEARNING OUTCOMES 
 
This course will contribute to each of the Department of Political Science’s five learning outcomes: 
critical and creative thinking, literacy, communicating, global understanding, and professional and 
ethical behaviour. Critical and creative thinking skills will be developed by applying knowledge of 
judicial review of the Charter to historical and recent controversies in Canadian politics. Literacy 
will be improved by written assignments and by the instructor’s written feedback on those 
assignments. Communicating will be improved through a strong focus on in-class activities, group 
discussion, and larger class discussions. Studying the role of judicially-enforceable bills of rights 
with an eye to provincial, national, and comparative variations will enhance students’ global 
understanding of similarities and differences. Finally, professional and ethical behaviour will be 
fostered through lectures and activities that focus on teamwork, thoughtful inquiry, and 
understanding of diverse perspectives. 
 
 
EMAIL POLICY 
 
Emails are to be treated as a form of professional communication with your instructor and teaching 
assistants. Please treat emails formally, using proper grammar and etiquette. Email should be used 
sparingly, and is NOT a substitute for coming to lecture or understanding the readings. If you have 
a substantive question regarding the material or the assignments, you will be instructed to meet with 
the instructor or teaching assistants during office hours. Please consult the course outline and 
CourseLink before emailing your instructor.  
 
WRITING GUIDE 
 
Written assignments must conform to the Department of Political Science Writing Guide, which is 
available on CourseLink. The Department of Political Science Writing Guide sets out basic rules for 
academic writing and all students taking political science courses are required to be familiar with 
and follow these instructions for their written assignments. 
 
CLASSROOM CONDUCT 
 
Questions and discussion are encouraged in the classroom. All students are expected to demonstrate 
respect toward other class members and the instructor.  
 
 5 
The following is not permitted in the classroom, either during lecture or during group work: 
listening to music, speaking on the phone, reading the newspaper, surfing the web, watching 
streaming online content, talking during instructions, and other distracting behaviour. Cell phones 
must be turned off or switched to airplane mode during class. Headphones must not be worn. 
Laptop computers should be on silent.  
 
GROUP WORK 
 
Many lectures will be organized to incorporate group work. On many occasions, students will be 
divided into groups of 3-4 and will be asked to discuss questions based on readings and lecture 
material. We will then discuss the questions as a class. Groups will often be asked to write or type 
responses to questions in order to facilitate discussion.  
  
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF COURSE MATERIALS 
 
Course materials from lectures and on CourseLink (e.g. syllabus, assignment, hand-outs) cannot be 
redistributed without the prior consent of the instructor. You may not make a visual and/or audio 
recording, openly or surreptitiously, of any seminar material delivered in a course without the 
written permission of the course instructor.
