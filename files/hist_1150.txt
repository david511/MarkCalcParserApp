1 Course Details
1.1 Calendar Description
This course is a survey of the twentieth century, focusing on major events and themes such 
as: the First and Second World Wars, the Great Depression, the rise and fall of fascism, social 
movements, revolutions, genocides, decolonization, nationalism, the Cold War, and the rise 
and decline of American power. The course draws its examples and case studies mainly from 
regions across the world, with the intention of broadening critical awareness and fostering 
global citizenship. (C)
1.2 Course Description
The Modern World offers a broad survey of the major events, issues and themes of world 
history in the modern era in a way that is intended to introduce both program and non-
program students to the discipline of history.  This introductory course aims to challenge 
students to think critically about the nature and development of global interrelatedness, 
culture contact, identity and difference, the impact of technology, the democratization of 
society, and mass communications.  The course will emphasize themes of hegemony and 
resistance, and the tremendous social, political and economic changes that occurred in 
regions of Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America.  Great power imperialism and 
nationalist opposition, struggles against foreign domination in the post-colonial era, 
challenges to global economic and political structures, resistance to race and gender 
hierarchies, and technological, intellectual and environmental movements, are all aspects of 
the contemporary world.  The course also aims to develop analytical, conceptual and literary 
skills through class discussion, assigned readings, and an essay.  Our class time will be 
divided among lecture, discussion, and film, as necessary.

6 Assessments
6.1 Marking Schemes & Distributions
The format of Midterm and Final exams will be explained in more detail some time during 
class, but they will be based upon readings, lectures, and film content.  You are expected to 
attend class; if you do not, you will find the exams very difficult.  We will discuss themes 
from the readings weekly and your engagement in these discussions will prove helpful to you 
in problematizing history. 
 
The term paper will consist of a document analysis of 1 primary reading from the Overfield 
text (it can be an assigned or unassigned excerpt).  The paper should take a position with 
regard to a particular historical problem or issue that has caught your interest during the 
term.  If you are unsure as to whether or not your idea for a paper topic is suitable, please 
communicate your idea to your GTA for feedback (this does NOT mean we will read a rough 
draft or outline!)  The length is 1700 words (7 pages). Students are to complete the 
assignment independently. Students are required to utilize at least 5 additional primary or 
secondary sources, to clarify your historical analysis. At least 2 of these additional sources 
must be books; the others must be academic, peer-reviewed journal articles or scholarly 
book chapters.  Only peer-reviewed journal articles are acceptable internet sources!!!  All 
sources are to be properly footnoted and cited in the bibliography using the  academically 
acceptable citation style called Chicago Manual of Style that you must use consistently 
throughout the paper.  If you need assistance in learning to properly footnote/cite sources, 
please see the Dept. of History website’s information:  
https://www.uoguelph.ca/history/sites/uoguelph.ca.history/files/Student%20Resources.pdf 
 
You may want to refer students to the very useful Writing Guide by Dr. Femi Kolapo which is 
available on our website: 
https://www.uoguelph.ca/history/sites/uoguelph.ca.history/files/writingguide.pdf 
 
Page 15 of 22
HIST*1150 C01 F19 v2.00
There are useful tips on writing papers posted on Courselink.  The Chicago Manual of Style 
has an online quick guide for citation.  Make use of these reference tools.

Assignments are to be submitted on white paper; typed or computer printed; page-set up of 1-
Page 16 of 22
HIST*1150 C01 F19 v2.00
inch margins of document on all sides; double spaced lines (12pt); 12pt regular font (Times 
or Times Roman); pages are to be consecutively numbered. The paper should be stapled and 
have a separate title page, which includes the student’s name and student number, 
instructor’s name properly spelled, and the course number. Do not submit booklets. No 
diagrams or extraneous detail are to appear on the paper. Students are to maintain a copy of 
their paper. Inability or unwillingness to observe the guidelines for assignments will result in 
serious deductions.
6.4 Footnoting
Students must follow the proper rules for footnoting and bibliographical research, using the 
Chicago Manual of Style, latest edition. Hist. 1150’s online website contains some useful tips 
on writing papers and footnoting. The Department of History website also provides a guide 
on Writing History Essays.  Evaluation is based on work and the submission of work of the 
student’s own effort. Plagiarism means to take the ideas, writing, or arguments of others and 
pass them off as one’s own. If quoting directly from a book (source), enclose that material in 
double quotation marks and indicate the source with a reference (citation). When citing that 
you are borrowing from a source, though not directly lifting the words, place a reference at the 
end of the borrowed material, though without quotation marks. Proper footnoting and 
bibliographical style composes part of the learning process and students will be evaluated on 
this. Inability or refusal to follow these regulations will result in deduction of marks or 
possibly a failed assignment.

7 Course Statements
7.1 Penalties for Late Assignments
Assignments are to be submitted either via Dropbox or as a hard copy in class as instructed 
by the professor, and ON THEIR ASSIGNED DUE DATES; exceptions will be made only in the 
case of documented medical emergency. Please be aware that if you do not hand your 
assignment in on the due date, it will be considered late up to the point at which it is in my 
hands or when the date in which it was uploaded.  If you leave the paper in my mailbox in the 
History Department, or if you slide the paper under my door, there are no guarantees I will get 
your paper on that day.  You will incur penalties until I have the paper in hand, regardless of 
the circumstances, if you do not turn it in on time.  You need to communicate with me as 
soon as possible if you do not submit your paper on time.  If you do not, I am not responsible 
for any difficulties you encounter due to late submission.  Extensions must be requested at 
least 5 days in advance.  The History Office does not date stamp papers. 
 
  
 
Page 17 of 22
HIST*1150 C01 F19 v2.00
These are NOT legitimate reasons to be granted an extension: 
 
Computer or printer problems•
Assignments are due at the same time in other courses•
You have to do an extra shift in your job that week•
You will be away that week•
If you will be away on the day an assignment is due, you MUST make arrangements to get a 
hard copy to me ahead of time, or have a friend bring it to class for you.  
 
A PENALTY OF 4/100 POINTS PER DAY (INCLUDING WEEKENDS AND HOLIDAYS) WILL BE 
SUBTRACTED FROM THE FINAL PAPER MARK FOR LATE PAPERS HANDED IN PAST THE 
DUE DATE FOR ASSIGNMENTS.  
 
Emailed attachments from students will NOT be accepted, except with prior permission 
from the instructor.  Course work may be accepted up till the last day of scheduled classes in 
the term with the professor’s permission, but this will be subject to the above 4/100 points 
penalty. 
 
If a student cannot complete the assignment prior to the last scheduled class of term, inform 
the instructor.  No make-up tests will be administered without medical or compassionate 
documentation. No exemption from penalty for late assignments will be granted except in the 
case of legitimate illness and a BA counsellor or doctor’s certificate detailing a student’s 
consequent inability to meet the assignment deadline. Explanations for late papers scribbled 
on assignments will not be accepted as legitimate reason to exempt papers from late 
penalties. Students experiencing difficulties and personal problems not related to the course 
are advised and encouraged to go to the Counselling Services to discuss their problems. 
Student counselling will contact the instructor if consideration for course work is to apply. 
Plan ahead and GET YOUR WORK IN ON TIME. Penalties add up and can imperil a student’s 
standing in the course and in the university. It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that 
her/his work is submitted on time, and attendance at examinations met. 
 
  
 
TURNITIN 
 
In this course, your instructor may use Turnitin, integrated with the CourseLink Dropbox tool, 
Page 18 of 22
HIST*1150 C01 F19 v2.00
to detect possible plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration or copying as part of the ongoing 
efforts to maintain academic integrity at the University of Guelph. 
 
All submitted assignments will be included as source documents in the Turnitin.com 
reference database solely for the purpose of detecting plagiarism of such papers. Use of the 
Turnitin.com service is subject to the Usage Policy posted on the Turnitin.com site. 
 
A major benefit of using Turnitin is that students will be able to educate and empower 
themselves in preventing academic misconduct. In this course, you may screen your own 
assignments through Turnitin as many times as you wish before the due date. You will be 
able to see and print reports that show you exactly where you have properly and improperly 
referenced the outside sources and materials in your assignment. 
 
  
 
Classroom Etiquette and Useful Tools 
 
To avoid distraction, the History Department requests that you turn off your wireless 
connections during class unless requested by the instructor to do otherwise. The Department 
maintains a web site http://www.uoguelph.ca/history ) that will be helpful in various ways to 
students in History courses - such as conveying names of student award winners, information 
on undergraduate and graduate programs at Guelph, and news of the Department. There are 
useful links to on-line resources that include A Guide to Writing History Research Essays 
which will be valuable to students in all History courses. The University of Guelph History 
Society operates a number of programs to assist History undergraduates, and information 
about these programs can be accessed through the Department website or 
http://www.uoguelph.ca/~histsoc.  
 
7.2 Email Correspondence
The large class size makes it impractical for me to encourage email correspondence as a way 
to further class discussion.   Students are, therefore, advised not to send me email messages 
asking for explanations or clarification on topics / questions discussed in class or arising 
from the assigned reading materials.  Do not send email requests asking that I go over the 
outline of your essay or assignment.   If you send me an email, please note that I do not 
typically respond to work email on the weekends.  Make use of my office hours and/or the 
office hours of the TA assigned to you.

8.4 Copies of Out-of-class Assignments
Keep paper and/or other reliable back-up copies of all out-of-class assignments: you may be

8.5 Accessibility
The University promotes the full participation of students who experience disabilities in their 
academic programs. To that end, the provision of academic accommodation is a shared 
Page 20 of 22
HIST*1150 C01 F19 v2.00
responsibility between the University and the student. 
 
When accommodations are needed, the student is required to first register with Student 
Accessibility Services (SAS). Documentation to substantiate the existence of a disability is 
required; however, interim accommodations may be possible while that process is underway. 
 
Accommodations are available for both permanent and temporary disabilities. It should be 
noted that common illnesses such as a cold or the flu do not constitute a disability. 
 
Use of the SAS Exam Centre requires students to book their exams at least 7 days in advance 
and not later than the 40th Class Day. 
 
For Guelph students, information can be found on the SAS website

For Ridgetown students, information can be found on the Ridgetown SAS website

8.6 Academic Integrity
The University of Guelph is committed to upholding the highest standards of academic 
integrity, and it is the responsibility of all members of the University community-faculty, staff, 
and students-to be aware of what constitutes academic misconduct and to do as much as 
possible to prevent academic offences from occurring. University of Guelph students have 
the responsibility of abiding by the University's policy on academic misconduct regardless of 
their location of study; faculty, staff, and students have the responsibility of supporting an 
environment that encourages academic integrity. Students need to remain aware that 
instructors have access to and the right to use electronic and other means of detection. 
 
Please note: Whether or not a student intended to commit academic misconduct is not 
relevant for a finding of guilt. Hurried or careless submission of assignments does not excuse 
students from responsibility for verifying the academic integrity of their work before 
submitting it. Students who are in any doubt as to whether an action on their part could be 
construed as an academic offence should consult with a faculty member or faculty advisor.
