Teaching and Learning Practices   
Background 
Readings 
Each topic contains readings about related concepts and issues.  Readings 
are to be completed prior to attending class.   
On-line 
presentations 
PowerPoint presentations are available on the course website.   
On-line WileyPlus 
assignments 
Assignments (WileyPlus required) are similar to the questions discussed in 
class. They will be done on-line using WileyPlus. The assignments are not 
timed, and you have two attempts for each question. If you miss a deadline 
for whatever reason, the assignment will be recorded as zero. There is no 
re-weighting of marks for assignments. 
Problems for class 
discussion 
You will be assigned problems and exercises which form an integral part of 
each class discussion. These problems approximate the difficulty level you 
should expect to see on exams.  You are to attempt the in-class problems 
prior to attending class.  In addition, there will be problems handed out and 
completed in class.  If you miss a class, it will be your responsibility to obtain 
a copy of the problem and solution. 
Self-study problems In addition to the problems for class discussion, additional problems should 
be completed on a self-study basis to reinforce and clarify the in-class 
learning.  Solutions to brief exercise problems from the text will be posted 
to Courselink. 
Group written case 
report 
The group written assignment will provide you and your group members 
(no more than 5 students in a group.) with an opportunity to delve more 
deeply into the selected topic areas in the course. The assignment will 
include some less directed elements and will require demonstration of 
strong writing and organizing skills.  The group response should be 
formatted in a manner similar to the CPA Way which will be discussed in 
class. 
Students should not share or discuss their solutions with members of other 
groups.  One (hard) copy of the solution (per group) should be submitted as 
instructed in the course schedule and one (soft) copy to the drop box for 
ACCT 3340 in Courselink (Courselink automatically subjects all submissions 
to checks for plagiarism, etc., via turnitin.com). The solution to the case 
should be no more than 3 pages in length (minimum 12 font) -- plus up to 3 
pages for appendices for items such as journal entries or draft financial 
statements -- if applicable (see “Approach to Financial Accounting Cases” 
below for further details).

Course Resources 
Required Texts: 
Kieso, et al., Intermediate Accounting, Volume II, 11th Canadian Ed., John Wiley & Sons Canada Ltd., 
2016.   
[The text may be purchased in hard copy with “WileyPlus” access or as the online “eBook” 
version.  For students who are planning to pursue the CPA designation, we recommend the hard 
copy.  The material in this course is examinable within the professional program, and it’s useful to 
have the reference from which you originally learned the material. The e-book provides access 
only for 6 months.]   Note that used textbooks do not include “WileyPlus” access. 
 
CPAC Handbook. 
Electronic access to the CPAC Handbook can be obtained through the University of Guelph library.  
Because the Handbook is constantly being updated, a hardcopy version would become quickly 
updated, and is not recommended. 
 
Course Policies 
Grading Policies 
Unless you have discussed an extension well ahead of the due date with the instructor, late penalties of 
5% of the total grade earned per day (including weekends) will be assigned to any assessment (i.e. deducted 
from the total mark). Extensions will only be granted on the basis of valid reasons. Late assignments will 
not be accepted once graded assignments have been returned officially to the class at large, unless 
circumstances permit and alternative arrangements have been made. 
 
Students who find themselves unable to meet course requirements by the deadlines or the criteria 
expected because of medical or personal reasons, should review the regulations on academic consideration 
in the Academic Calendar and discuss their situation with the instructor, program counselor or other 
academic counselor as appropriate. 
 
http://www.uoguelph.ca/registrar/calendars/undergraduate/current/c08/c08-grds.shtml  
 
Missed Assignments: 
 
A grade of zero will be assigned if you fail to submit an assignment, unless you are ill or have other 
compassionate reasons. Please read your Undergraduate Calendar for the regulations regarding illness and 
compassionate grounds. Please note, vacation travel, moving house, or outside work commitments will 
not be accepted as valid reasons for missing deadlines. 
 
If you have religious observances which conflict with the course schedule or if you are registered with 
Student Accessibility Services, please contact the course instructor in order to make arrangements for your 
assessment if appropriate.

Missed online WileyPlus assignments 
There are no deferred on-line assignments. If you miss a deadline for whatever reason, the assignment will 
be recorded as zero. There is no re-weighting of marks for assignments. 
 
 
University Policies  
Academic Consideration 
When you find yourself unable to meet an in-course requirement because of illness or compassionate 
reasons, please advise the course instructor in writing, with your name, id#, and e-mail contact. See the 
academic calendar for information on regulations and procedures for Academic Consideration: 
http://www.uoguelph.ca/registrar/calendars/undergraduate/current/c08/c08-ac.shtml 
Academic Misconduct 
The University of Guelph is committed to upholding the highest standards of academic integrity and it is 
the responsibility of all members of the University community, faculty, staff, and students  to be aware of 
what constitutes academic misconduct and to do as much as possible to prevent academic offences from 
occurring.  
University of Guelph students have the responsibility of abiding by the University's policy on academic 
misconduct regardless of their location of study; faculty, staff and students have the responsibility of 
supporting an environment that discourages misconduct. Students need to remain aware that instructors 
have access to and the right to use electronic and other means of detection. Please note: Whether or not 
a student intended to commit academic misconduct is not relevant for a finding of guilt. Hurried or careless 
submission of assignments does not excuse students from responsibility for verifying the academic integrity 
of their work before submitting it. Students who are in any doubt as to whether an action on their part 
could be construed as an academic offence should consult with a faculty member or faculty advisor.  
The Academic Misconduct Policy is detailed in the Undergraduate Calendar: 
https://www.uoguelph.ca/registrar/calendars/undergraduate/current/c08/c08-amisconduct.shtml  
Accessibility 
The University of Guelph is committed to creating a barrier-free environment. Providing services for 
students is a shared responsibility among students, faculty and administrators. This relationship is based 
on respect of individual rights, the dignity of the individual and the University community's shared 
commitment to an open and supportive learning environment. Students requiring service or 
accommodation, whether due to an identified, ongoing disability or a short-term disability should contact 
Student Accessibility Services as soon as possible.
